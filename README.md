Hi! I'm Matt Dunn. I'm a fullstack software engineer located in San Francisco.

My passion for coding is not isolated to any particular tech stack, workflow, or sector of engineering; 
in and out of my work life, I find beauty in organization, simplicity, and elegant solutions to problems of all sizes.
I'm a problem solver at heart, and my greatest satisfaction comes in finding good solutions to new problems and better solutions to existing problems.
